## Code Explanation

The Java code uses a `do-while` loop to allow players to play multiple rounds. Randomly chosen fruits are stored in an array, and the player's input is used to determine the deposited money. The code checks for matching fruits and calculates earnings accordingly. The game statistics, including total deposited money, total earned money, and profit, are displayed at the end of the game.

To play the game:

1. Compile the Java code.
2. Run the compiled program.
3. Enter the money you want to deposit.
